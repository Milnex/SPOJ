=================

## Problem code: GNY07A

Misspelling is an art form that students seem to excel at. Write a program that removes the nth character from an input string.  

## Input

The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) which is the number of datasets that follow.  

Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing M, a space, and a single word made up of uppercase letters only. M will be less than or equal to the length of the word. The length of the word is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 80.  

## Output

For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and the misspelled word. The misspelled word is the input word with the indicated character deleted.  

## Example

### Input:
4  
4 MISSPELL  
1 PROGRAMMING  
7 CONTEST  
3 BALLOON  

### Output:
1 MISPELL  
2 ROGRAMMING  
3 CONTES  
4 BALOON
